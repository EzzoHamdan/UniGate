# UniGate
The 'University Gate' project was developed to serve as a university webpage. Its primary objective is to showcase our proficiency in project development for the Web Application Development 2 course undertaken during my first semester of junior year. The project demonstrates proficiency in CSHTML, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, and backend development.
